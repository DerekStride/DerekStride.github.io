### Introduction

This Project hosts the code for my project to make an LCD screen that will be controlled by the Atmega328p with the Arduino bootloader on it. I will be using various tutorials and guides and will provide the link to all of them in the Sources section below.

Essentially, this is a collection of all the resources you'll need to get the microcontroller to continually send and change messages on an LCD screen. I recommend soldering components to a protobroad and providing plugs for the pins when you want to reflash the code with new messages. It makes for a **great** gift if you make it look nice!

### Quick Reference Guide

1.  Get all the gear you'll need
2.  Test the LCD with the Raspberry Pi using the [Adafruit_Python_CharLCD](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_CharLCD) library
    *    Alternatively you can test with the Arduino Uno using the    [LiquidCrystal](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal) library and Eliminate the need for the python library
3.  Test the Atmega328p with the Raspberry Pi using a modified avrdude


{% highlight bash %}
cd /tmp
wget http://project-downloads.drogon.net/gertboard/avrdude_5.10-4_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i avrdude_5.10-4_armhf.deb
sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/avrdude
{% endhighlight %}


4.  Link the LCD with the Atmega328p

### The Gear You'll Need

1.  [Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1914) (Any model will work, I used the B+)
2.  [Atmega328p w/ Arduino Bootloader](https://www.adafruit.com/products/123) (Grab 2 just in case you fry one)
3.  [A Breadboard](https://www.adafruit.com/products/239)
4.  [16 MHz Oscillator](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1873)
5.  General Electronics Gear
    *   Jumper Wires
    *   Resistors
    *   Multimeter
    *   Pliers
    *   Anything Else You Expect Will Help

### Guide

First things first you need to gather all the gear that's listed above. If you don't have it, order it all and come back when you have it, or just continue as much as possible, whatever you prefer.

#### Testing the LCD (Optional)

I followed this [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/character-lcd-with-raspberry-pi-or-beaglebone-black/overview) on adafruit to test the LCD.
