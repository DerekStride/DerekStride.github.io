### Introduction

I've noticed that the labs have been getting pretty difficult and most of it isn't from the content. A lot of the difficulty comes from understanding and getting the workflow set up. I've taken the time to figure out common problems with miniIDE, NoICE, and ICC12. These 3 programs are essential to getting working code on the Axiom board. So I've made a list of things you'll need to do in order to get everything working.

### Tips You'll want to Know

I'll Update this as I learn more but for now here's a sample on different important topics we covered.

#### PWM - Pulse Width Modulation

Essentially, PWM is a way to simulate an analog signal using just digital signals. Lets say Logic 0 is 0V and Logic 1 is 5V and you look a period of 1 second. If you're connected to a motor you can run it at 20% speed by sending it a 1V signal. However, to simulate it theoretically you have to pulse a digital 5V for 200 ms every second.

#### PORTS and Their Associated Registers

Each Port (ex Port K) has multiple registers associated with it that's used to make them work. There is the **Data Direction** Register (ex DDRK) and the **Data** Register (PORTK).

* The Direction registers tell you whether it's configured as output or input.
* The Data registers tells you what bits are high/low at that port.
  * It it's configured as output this is where you'll set the output to high/low. If it's configured as input this is where you'll read the data from.

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### Settings

##### NoICE Settings

The most important settings come from NoICE, notice the COM Port is set to COM1 and the Baud Rate is 19200. This is what is required to interface with the HC12 chip.

##### MiniIDE Settings

![MiniIDE Settings](/assets/projects/{{ page.folder }}/miniIDEsetting.jpg)

In MiniIDE make sure the Terminal settings are set to COM1 and 19200 to match  what NoICE is expecting, that way files you build in MiniIDE will work on the board.

##### ICC Settings

![ICC Compiler Settings](/assets/projects/{{ page.folder }}/ICCsettings.jpg)

The ICC Compiler also needs special settings (under the project menu), you want custom device settings, set the PC to **0x4000**, the Data Memory to **0x1000**, and the stack pointer to **0x3DFF**. Make sure all other settings are the same too. Under the compiler tab make sure the output is **Motorola S19** (with source debugging for better debugging info).

#### MiniIDE

![Assembly Files](/assets/projects/{{ page.folder }}/asmFiles.jpg)

For the assembly files you write in MiniIDE, in order to include a file you'll need to put it at the end. The reason is you'll need the code *after* the `ORG $4000`.

{% include code_snippets/{{ page.folder }}/labPrototype.asm %}

#### ICC12

![Make sure to addFiles](/assets/projects/{{ page.folder }}/addFiles.jpg)

For the ICC12 Compiler you'll need to create a new project where the entire path (`M:\SYSC2003\Labs\LabxProj.prj`) has no spaces **(NONE, 0, NO)**. THEN, you'll need to add ALL files you'll need to the project. Including new ones you create as you go.

NOTE: Forgetting to add newly created files is a common mistake I make often.

You'll also need to write code in an old style. Specifically you'll need to declare variables before using them in the functions. Notice the LCD_displayStr function below with `int i;` declared at the top before use in the loop.

{% highlight c %}

{% include code_snippets/{{ page.folder }}/labDemo.c %}

{% endhighlight %}


#### NoICE

![NoICE Loading File](/assets/projects/{{ page.folder }}/NoICEload.jpg)

Make sure you're loading HEX files otherwise the .S19 files won't appear.

![Setting PC in NoICE](/assets/projects/{{ page.folder }}/NoICEPC.jpg)

Make sure to set the PC to 4000. Also it's important to close NoICE and then flick the board off/on again before opening NoICE and reloading files to make sure it works properly. ALWAYS close NoICE and flick power.
