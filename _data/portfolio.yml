# About Section

blurb: >
  I'm a software engineering student studying at Carleton University  in Ottawa, ON. I have a passion for learning the latest cutting edge technology and teaching others how to use it as well. Whether it's low level coding on a BeagleBone Black or high level web development with Jekyll, I'm interested in it and want to know more.

  I have a lot of plans coming up in the future, I want to start making guides and posting them on this site, and eventually I want to start making videos showing how to do the various projects I've done. I want these to be both instructional and informational so that you can know what you're doing and why you're doing it this way.

  excerpt: >
    CU in the Air is a group of Carleton University engineering students that have come together to put their love for creative thinking and problem solving to the test. As we are always looking for a challenge, the GSBC grabbed our attention immediately. Excited to see what kind of results we can produce, CU in the Air has officially joined the effort in celebrating an age where anyone can reach the edge of space for no more than a few hundred dollars.
