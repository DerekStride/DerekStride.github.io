# About Section

blurb: >
  I'm a software engineering student studying at Carleton University  in Ottawa, ON. I have a passion for learning the latest cutting edge technology and teaching others how to use it as well. Whether it's low level coding on a BeagleBone Black or high level web development with Jekyll, I'm interested in it and want to know more.

  I have a lot of plans coming up in the future, I want to start making guides and posting them on this site, and eventually I want to start making videos showing how to do the various projects I've done. I want these to be both instructional and informational so that you can know what you're doing and why you're doing it this way.
