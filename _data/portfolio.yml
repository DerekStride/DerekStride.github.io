# About Section

blurb: >
  Derek is an engineering student at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, and grew up in the magnificent province of Newfoundland and Labrador. He has a passion for learning; whether it be low-level coding on the TI Launchpad, front end web development with Jekyll, or configuration management with CHEF. While developing code to run underwater and in the stratosphere are projects from the past, he has yet to place anything of his own on Mars, but claims that it's coming and NASA can't stop him.

  excerpt: >
    CU in the Air is a group of Carleton University engineering students that have come together to put their love for creative thinking and problem solving to the test. As we are always looking for a challenge, the GSBC grabbed our attention immediately. Excited to see what kind of results we can produce, CU in the Air has officially joined the effort in celebrating an age where anyone can reach the edge of space for no more than a few hundred dollars.
