## Main Projects

[Vector Manipulator](https://github.com/DerekStride/Homework-Solvers)

A collection of little programs made in different languages that do various vector manipulations. I use these to help me learn the syntax and standard practices of new languages I learn.

[Atmega328 Powered LCD](https://http://derekstride.github.io/Atmega328-LCD/)

I'm interested in Embedded systems and wanted to start a little project. This project uses the microcontroller from the Arduino UNO to control an LCD. The program is flashed to the chip by a Raspberry Pi.
